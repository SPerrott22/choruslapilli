# _Chorus Lapilli_ aka "Dancing Grains"

This project was adapted off of code from the React tic tac toe tutorial: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

## Rules

"Chorus lapilli is like tic-tac-toe in that players take turn placing pieces on a 3 by 3 board and the goal is to get three pieces in a row. However, it differs from tic-tac-toe in two ways:

After your first three moves, instead of adding further pieces you must instead move one of your existing pieces to an adjacent empty square. Therefore, after your third move you always occupy three squares. The move can be up, down, left, right, or diagonal.

If it is your turn to move and you have three pieces on the board and one of your pieces is in the center square, your move must either win or vacate the center square."

-- Professor Eggert

## How to Run

Open these files locally and run

`npm install`

`npm start`

You may have to first put

App.css			index.js		setupTests.js
App.js			logo.svg		styles.css
App.test.js		reportWebVitals.js

into a folder named "src"

and then put

favicon.ico	logo192.png	manifest.json
index.html	logo512.png	robots.txt

into a folder named "public"

So that you have the following in your current directory

README.md		package.json		src
chorus-lapilli.txt	public			tic-tac-toe.txt

Note: the txt files are just a documentation of how I built this (and how I first built tic-tac-toe before this, which isn't included here but you can follow the steps on the tutorial).
